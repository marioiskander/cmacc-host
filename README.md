# cmacc-host<br>
A bare folder and some stubs for the CommonAccord application.  <br>

# MAKE AN INSTANCE:

1.  On your computer you will need two standard software packages:  A) "LAMP" stack web server and B) git.  

  A.  For the "LAMP" stack, I use MAMP successfully on my Mac.  https://www.mamp.info/en/  download and install in /Applications/.  On the MAMP "Web Server" tab - select Apache web server and set to something like ~{user}/Sites.  Start the servers (you won't use MySQL, but it seems to start anyway).
  
  B. On Mac - https://desktop.github.com/ 
  
2. Start "cloning" the necessary files.  

  A. From https://github.com/CommonAccord/cmacc-host, Clone using the green "Clone of Download" button, then the "Open in Desktop".  Guide the clone to be in ~{user}/Sites/.  
  B. From https://github.com/CommonAccord/cmacc-app, Clone using the green "Clone of Download" button then the "Open in Desktop".  Guide the clone to be in ~{user}/Sites/cmacc-host/vendor/.
  C. Start adding documents:  https://github.com/CommonAccord/Z-CmA, Clone using the green "Clone of Download" button.  Clone, using "Open in Desktop".  Guide the clone to be in ~{user}/Sites/cmacc-host/Doc/G/.  Rename so it becomes ~{user}/Sites/cmacc-host/Doc/G/Z/.  
  D. Test:  Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:8888/cmacc-host/index.php?action=list&file=G/Z/ol/3.  See if you get a page, and if so, click on "Document".  You should get a little, bare section list with {Ti} 1. {1.Sec} 2. {2.Sec} 3. {3.Sec}.  If so, success!  Continue by cloning materials you want to work on.  Keep an eye out for their listed "DEPENDENCIES".  You will need to clone those, too.

You can add files using a text editor, move files using a file manager, edit files with an editor or the "Edit" view in the app.  If you use an IDE - for instance Emacs - you can make edits across groups of files and otherwise improve your productivity.
